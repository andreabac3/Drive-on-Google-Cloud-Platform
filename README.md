4) Configure your Google Cloud Platform account with the GCP CLI and do the same for the Firebase API
5) You have to replace in code your authentication code otherwise you cannot access to the cloud services


### Documentation
We provide a documentation (pdf file in the repository root) but it's avaiable in Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ language.


We found very hard working with documentation with the huge ammount of  API version, a common problem is that find the right maven repository version for the example in documentation.
