A complete drive system built on Google Cloud platform with Spring using AppEngine, Firebase auth, Cloud functions, Cloud Storage.

This repository is a sort of code base for the use of Spring Framework in a serveless way with the aid of other google cloud services.

5) You have to replace in code your authentication code otherwise you cannot access to the cloud services <br>
   5.1 Firebase Auth token in FirebaseLib constructor in the line .setDatabaseUrl("XXX")<br>
   5.2 FileController abstract class init change the byte array with your GCP configuration file.<br>



### Documentation
We provide a documentation (pdf file in the repository root) but it's avaiable in Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ language.


We found very hard working with documentation with the huge ammount of  API version, a common problem is that find the right maven repository version for the example in documentation.
